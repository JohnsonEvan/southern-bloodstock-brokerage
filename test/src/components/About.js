            <br/>
            <p>I have been self-employed as a broker of high-end performance horses and breeding stock through private and public sales for 4 years. I must communicate efficiently, serve as a liaison between buyers and sellers, and arrange transport both domestically and internationally. I help to ensure paperwork is in order at time of purchase that may include, but is not limited to, veterinary and performance records, registration paperwork, and finances.</p>
